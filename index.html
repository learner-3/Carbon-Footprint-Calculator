        <h2>Understanding Global Warming and Carbon Footprint</h2>
        <p>Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's climate system, primarily due to human activities. The release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), contributes to the greenhouse effect, trapping heat and causing the Earth's average temperature to rise.</p>
        
        <p>One way to measure your impact on global warming is by calculating your carbon footprint. It represents the total amount of greenhouse gases, measured in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), that you contribute to the atmosphere through activities like energy consumption, transportation, and more.</p>
